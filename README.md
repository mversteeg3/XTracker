# XTracker
Uses CLLocationManager to track location.  When the app is put into the background, it will automatically switch to using the less power-intensive form of location tracking that will also prevent the app from being rejected for abuse of the locations API.  Uses the Google Places API to geocode the user's location when their map pin is pressed.
